# SQL_BourbonTastingProject

QUICK OVERVIEW

My project is currently in 3 scripts, a table creation script, table insert script, and project script. Open and run the table creation script first, then the table insert script. After those have run you many then run the queries in the project script. The queries may be run individually or as a whole. 

DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS

1.) Download the repository from GitHub
2.) Open Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (This project was created on Version 18)
3.) Open all 3 files within SSMS (In version 18 can be done by navigating to File--->Open--->File, or using the ctrl+O shortcut)
4.) Execute the BourbonProjectTable script. This will create the BourbonTasting database and the project tables within that database.
5.) Execute the BourbonProjectData script. This will populate the necessary data within the BourbonTasting tables
6.) Execute the BourbonTastingsProject script. This will run all the queries required for the Code Louisville SQL project.

*NOTE*: If you would like to test each query separately, you must make sure to open a New Query on the BourbonTasting database. The individual queries may be pasted into this window, or you may paste the entire BourbonTastingsProject file into there, then highlight the individual queries and execute them.
